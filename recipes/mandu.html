        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These small Korean egg rolls <em>(also called mandu)</em>
        are made with wonton wrappers, cabbage, beef, and pork.</p> 
        <p>For larger rolls, use egg roll wrappers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can bean sprouts - drained, rinsed, and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 cup minced celery</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped (white part only)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) packages wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer meat mixture to a large bowl, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>While the meat is cooking, place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cabbage, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, green onion, soy sauce, cornstarch, sesame oil, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Spoon mixture into the center of each wonton wrapper. Brush beaten egg onto two edges of each wrapper and fold wrapper around filling, sealing the edges together.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry wontons in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Finish filling and forming remaining wontons while each batch cooks. Drain cooked wontons on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
